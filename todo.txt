Sample Deployment Policy Test Run
    - fixed issue with policy loading properly (new?)
    - in doing the deployment and loading it up on a webserver two problems
      were noticed. 
    - first several forms point to the origin server, these need to be fixed
      via a separate deployment skin.
      
    - second the css import urls are also pointing back to the origin server,
      the uri resolver needs to be fixed.  (I noticed this in a couple areas)
      
      #### this is now fixed
      
      form urls as well cause problems for the resolver.
      
      ### leaving this unfixed for now the use cases for deploying dynamic actions
      ### in static deployment aren't clear.
      
    - deployment link errors
